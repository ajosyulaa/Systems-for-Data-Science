In this project, you will have to implement a simple image classification server. You will use a pre-trained model and build a container to use the model for inference.

You should use the PyTorch machine learning framework, an open-source library based on the Torch library. You are required to use a pre-trained Densenet-121 model for Pytorch, which is publicly available online. Your code will use the model for inference: it will take an image as an input and return a classification as an output. You are not required to change, retrain, or modify the model.

Your code should run as a backend server that handles HTTP requests. The HTTP requests will include test images to classify. The server will be included in a docker container using a Python 3.7 image as the launching point. You are required to create a README file that lists the steps required to run the classifier. The steps should be straightforward. They should just involve running the docker image and then sending a POST or GET request with the test image file to the server running the docker container.

We will run your docker image and query the server using images of animals taken from the Internet. The focus of the evaluation will not be on accuracy (since you will be using a pre-trained model). We will mainly evaluate that you have learned the basic functionalities of PyTorch and Docker that you can put them together to build an inference serving system.

You will get an invitation for your GitHub repo for this assignment on Piazza. You should make frequent commits to this repository - do not simply dump code into the repository before submission, or we will be forced to assume that you are plagiarizing code. You will not be able to push new updates after the due date.
